Refine a `{spec, plan}` into an execution-ready **3-doc** (handoff + spec + plan)
grounded in the real project code. The output is consumed by `go`. The 3-doc contract is in
`references/output-format.md`.

**The input is the `{spec, plan}` files plus the project code — nothing else.** The files are the
whole record of intent, whatever their source (hand-written or exported from another tool). Where
the files and code can't settle an intent, **escalate to the user** — never invent it, and never
attribute intent to a conversation that isn't in the files (the fabrication trap).

## Core principles (apply throughout)

- **Serve the spec.** spec is ground truth (WHAT to build). plan is a provisional
  blueprint — revise it freely. Existing code is legacy: a reference for HOW and a
  reality-check for the plan's claims, never the authority for WHAT.
- **escalate-don't-guess.** Anything you cannot derive from spec/plan + project code,
  do NOT invent — ask the user.
- **Floor, not ceiling.** These phases are a proven scaffold: follow the structure, but
  use judgment inside each step. Do not hardcode verification checklists — derive
  criteria from the spec/project as needed.
- **Stack-agnostic.** Discover project specifics (build targets, regen commands,
  conventions, registration points) during GATHER; never assume a stack.
- **Harness-aware.** At GATHER, detect a project harness (a `CLAUDE.md` with dryforge structure + a
  `docs/` directory). If present, load it as project context — don't re-ask what it answers, and if
  this task may conflict with a harness decision, surface the conflict to the user (don't
  self-resolve). If absent, proceed as before. set does not know the `docs/` structure.
- **Match the user's language (language-agnostic).** Like stack-agnosticism, the *method* is fixed
  and the *specific language* is discovered at runtime, never assumed: produce every user-facing
  output — the dialogue **and the 3-doc** — in the language the user communicates in, written
  **natively** (as a fluent speaker of that language would, never translationese). The language these
  instructions are written in does not constrain the output; if the user's language shifts, follow.
- **Talk to the user only when needed, in plain words — default to silence on process.** Emit
  user-facing text only for: (a) a question you genuinely need answered, (b) the final result or a
  concise summary, (c) a real blocker — optionally prefixed by a one-line, user-meaningful heading
  for the current step. Nothing else: don't narrate *what* you're doing, *how*, or *why* a step is
  needed; don't expose internal mechanics (reference/file names, phase/mode/lens labels, "loading
  references", "Read N files"). Write what you do say in a **plain, non-technical register** — the
  words a non-engineer would understand. This is your default voice, not a per-line check, so it
  costs nothing. **Never surface internal tokens:** dryforge mechanism / coined terms (wave,
  worktree, harness, delta, 3-doc, gate, seam, ROI collapse, spec-review, grounding, lens,
  invariant), task / step / risk labels (`T1`, `Wave 2`, RISKY / MECHANICAL / NONE), or
  project-internal jargon a non-engineer wouldn't recognize (library/tool names, config flags,
  test-framework internals). **Don't soften internal logic into user-ish words — just omit it.** E.g.
  "Starting a git repo here." — not "Since go will later need git for worktrees, I'll initialize one
  (non-destructive setup)."

## Input & preconditions

- Invocation: the user invokes the `set` skill   with two paths in the prompt. Parse the two paths from the user's prompt text
  (whitespace- or quote-separated). Confirm **exactly two readable paths** resolved;
  if missing/unreadable, ask for them.
- **Input-validity precheck.** Confirm the spec has ≥1 **concrete requirement** and the plan has ≥1
  task with file targets. (A stub/empty plan vacuously satisfies "orphan = 0"; coverage-gap = 0 is
  only meaningful against a non-empty spec.) A **concrete requirement** = a rule/behavior/decision
  specific enough to test against — not a bare goal. If the precheck fails (stub/empty spec or plan),
  do not just stop — offer concrete recovery options and let the user pick: (a) flesh out the
  spec/plan here via targeted follow-up questions; (b) switch to dryforge `ready` for a full design
  dialogue; or (c) supply a different spec/plan path.
- **git required.** If the project is not a git repo, offer to run `git init` **and make an initial
  commit** (an empty repo has no HEAD, so go could not create a worktree). If git is
  not installed, stop and tell the user git is required (worktree isolation depends on it).
- Load the spec and plan into your own context — they are the workpiece you refine, not
  something to summarize via a subagent. For very large inputs, keep an index and edit
  section-by-section (the file is the store).

## Phase 1 — GATHER (understand the project)

**Harness detection (first).** Check for a project harness: a `CLAUDE.md` carrying the dryforge
structure **and** a `docs/` directory. If it exists, load `CLAUDE.md` + the relevant `docs/` as
project context, pre-resolve what the harness already answers (don't re-ask), and if this task may
conflict with a harness decision, identify it and **ask the user** (domain conflicts don't
self-resolve). If it doesn't exist, proceed with the behavior below. set uses the harness only as
reference — it does not know the `docs/` structure.

**GATHER budget.** Start with a cheap inline map: repo instructions, file list, manifests,
test/verify scripts, and the paths named by the incoming spec/plan. Dispatch read-only subagents
only when the project is large enough, unfamiliar enough, or broad enough that summary isolation will
save more context than it costs. Pattern & result-compaction: `references/subagent-management.md`.
For small or tightly-scoped inputs, keep GATHER inline and targeted.

- **Scout** (first, inline or delegated): project layout, conventions, entry points. Use
  `AGENTS.md` as a guide if present; otherwise explore and tell the user you are reading broadly.
- **Pattern + Infrastructure** (in parallel, using Scout's output): existing similar
  implementations (the HOW reference) + external constraints (infra, build config, deps).
  Discover the project's verify commands here. If none surface, that is not a silent default —
  carry it forward and resolve it explicitly in RESOLVE (see below).
- **Dispatch ROI test:** each delegated read must have a bounded scope and a named question. If you
  cannot say what summary would change the 3-doc, read inline instead.

## Phase 2 — VERIFY (check + fix structure)

Per-pass rules: `references/gap-analysis.md`.

- **Pass 1 — structure** (deterministic): do the plan's paths / build targets / imports
  exist? Use targeted `rg`/`find`/project-graph commands. **Fix structural mismatches
  immediately**, so later passes run against corrected docs.
- **Pass 2 — requirements** (bidirectional trace): every spec requirement maps to a task
  (else coverage gap); every task is grounded in spec (else orphan).
- **Pass 3 — cross-consistency**: spec internal contradictions, plan inconsistencies,
  spec↔plan divergence, project-convention fit.
- **Pass 4 — content depth probe**: per category (domain, security, architecture, convention), is the
  depth sufficient for the project's scale, or does it stay at generalities? Output a
  sufficient/insufficient verdict + concrete pointers — this drives whether ELICIT runs. Unlike Pass
  1, this does not auto-fix (depth is added through dialogue, not invented).
- If a GATHER summary is not enough to judge, dispatch a focused follow-up read (GATHER =
  broad; here = narrow).

## Phase 3 — ELICIT (deepen thin areas; conditional) — `references/set-elicit.md`

Conditional — run only when Pass 4 flagged a category **insufficient**; if all are sufficient, skip
to RESOLVE. Force-load `references/set-elicit.md`. Deepen each insufficient area through dialogue:
**extract** where the thin area is domain, **present** options where it is technical, reaching the
matching floor (domain: rules verifiable, no vague modifiers; technical: decisions closed by user
confirmation). **The files being the only record never excuses not asking** — find the ambiguities
in the files and pose them; never attribute intent to a conversation not in the files. **Ready-redirect:** if the probe shows first cycle (no
harness) + no code + many categories insufficient, do **not** deepen — tell the user the input is too
thin a foundation for set and to use `/dryforge:ready`.

## Phase 4 — RESOLVE (refine + ask)

Conversion & thinking-base rules: `references/refinement-rules.md`.

- **Auto-fix** (non-structural): premature code → behavioral contract; convention
  violations → project pattern; simple spec↔plan wording/cross-refs.
- **Thinking-base**: where the executing agent (reading only the 3-doc + code) could not derive a
  decision, record *decision + reason*. **Never fabricate** — if the reason is not on the record
  (stated in the spec/plan), escalate to the user instead of inventing one. The docs are the only
  record of intent; don't attribute a reason to a conversation that isn't in them.
- **Zero discovered verify commands** is itself a recorded decision, never left implicit: surface it
  and resolve to an explicit outcome — a custom check, human-approval evidence, or an explicit "none"
  — captured in the thinking-base.
- **User questions** (unresolved only): domain/scope/trade-off decisions, suspected spec
  errors. Briefly report what you auto-handled; ask only the unresolved, in priority order
  (blocking > data-integrity > missing-feature > optimization), each with a proposed answer.

## Phase 5 — GENERATE (produce the 3-doc)

3-doc contract: `references/output-format.md`. Execution Graph: `references/dependency-calc.md`.

- **handoff first** (governing doc): document roles + conflict resolution, file locations
  (project-root-relative, never machine-absolute) + execution shape, and hard gates. Source intent
  only from the spec/plan + project code; if it isn't on the record, omit it rather than invent it.
- **spec**: finalize (auto-fixes + thinking-base + user answers + required-verification).
- **plan**: finalize (behavioral contracts + thinking-base + phase narrative + shared-write
  prose guidance).
- **Execution Graph last** (after everything else is fixed): per-task `depends`;
  top-level `regen_barriers` (schema in output-format.md). **Scaffold is not a task** — `go` performs
  project initialization inline before dispatch; do not create a scaffold task in the graph.
  Compute dependencies here — go follows them, never re-judges. As the producer, also derive
  each task's optional `risk` tier
  (`RISKY | MECHANICAL | NONE`, per the heuristic in `references/dependency-calc.md`) while
  computing the graph — it sizes the implementer's per-task test ceremony only; omit it to let the
  implementer judge risk at build time.
- Write `handoff.md`, `spec.md`, `plan.md` to `.dryforge/` and notify. **Do not touch `.gitignore`,
  and do not commit anything** — leave `.dryforge/` as plain untracked files. `go` owns the git
  mechanics: it ignores `.dryforge/` on its own feature branch when it runs (and untracks a
  `.dryforge/` left tracked by a prior run), so `main` is never modified or made ahead of its remote
  by set. Then notify: "invoke the `go` skill to execute."
- **Tell the user to tidy the source `{spec, plan}` inputs.** If those input files live *inside* the
  repo as untracked files, they are **not** under `.dryforge/`, so go's clean-tree precondition will
  see them as foreign untracked work and stop. In the notify message, advise moving them out of the
  repo or adding them to `.gitignore` before running go (set must not delete the user's inputs
  itself — just surface it).

## Completion gate (avoid self-judgment A=A)

Done only when ALL hold:

- **Deterministic 0-signals**: coverage gaps = 0, orphan tasks = 0, structural mismatches = 0.
- **Content depth**: every category the Pass-4 probe assessed is **sufficient** — anything flagged
  insufficient was deepened in ELICIT (or the user explicitly accepted the limit / was routed to ready).
- **Fresh-agent probe**: dispatch a subagent that has NOT seen the brainstorming; give it
  only the 3-doc (it may read project code — what go consumes at run time) and ask what would block
  execution or what it would need to ask — have it **return a structured list of residual
  blockers/questions**. Point it explicitly at the **output / interface contract** too (the
  data model's entities/fields + constraints, response/output keys, status/enum value sets,
  uniqueness rules where the spec defines any) — a half-pinned contract is a recurring late-caught
  gap that blocks downstream work even when behavior reads clear. Residual → escalate to the user
  (do not self-fill). Empty → done.
